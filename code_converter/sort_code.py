# this module iterates over the sdk directory which is shown below in the
# "in_path", The out_path is one folder level down from this module. it will
# make a replica of the SDK folder at this location.
# this module opens up every .h file and indents the file based on the
# preprocessor syntax, #ifndef, #ifdef, #if, #elif and #else.
#
# By doing this it make it far easier to follow the nested
# preprocessor commands. It is with these commands where most of the issue
# arise from so being able to easily read the .h file to be able to fix a
# converted file is extremely important.
